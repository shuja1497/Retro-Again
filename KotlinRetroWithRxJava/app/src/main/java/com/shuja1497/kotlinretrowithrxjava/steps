1. Data class

2. add dependancy :
            // retrofit
            implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0"
            implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:adapter-rxjava2:2.3.0"
            implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.3.0"

            // rxandroid
            implementation "io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.0.1"

3. interface

4. companion object

5. lazy initialization and initializing disposable object

6. using interface to get the result

7. Since the fetching is happening on background asynchronously, thereâ€™s a possibility your activity
 could be terminated before the background fetch is done. So it is very important to stop the fetching
 mission whenever your activity is terminated.
 the disposable that was  instantiated does link to the Rx fetching handling. We could get it to
 terminate the process by calling dispose

 >> data class Result(val query: Query)

 the parameter name must be same as in json
